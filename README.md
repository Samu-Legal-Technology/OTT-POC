# OTT-POC (Proof of Concept)

## Overview

This repository serves as a proof-of-concept (POC) template for Samu Legal Technology projects. It provides a pre-configured development environment with comprehensive CI/CD capabilities through GitHub Actions, supporting multiple programming languages and automated quality assurance processes.

## Purpose

The OTT-POC repository is designed to:
- Serve as a starting template for new projects
- Demonstrate CI/CD best practices
- Provide a multi-language development framework
- Establish automated quality and security standards

## Features

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Workflows**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions configuration
- **Multi-Language Support**: Python, Node.js, and Java
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated linting, testing, and security scanning
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatic documentation stubs
- **PR Integration**: Automated comments on pull requests

### Supported Technologies

#### Languages & Runtimes
- **Python 3.11**: For data processing and backend services
- **Node.js 18**: For web applications and APIs
- **Java 17 (Temurin)**: For enterprise applications

#### Build Tools
- **pip**: Python package management
- **npm**: Node.js package management
- **Maven**: Java build automation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Depending on your chosen technology stack, ensure you have:
- Git
- GitHub account with repository access
- One or more of: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, Java 17+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samu-Legal-Technology/OTT-POC.git
cd OTT-POC
```

2. Choose your technology stack and create appropriate configuration:
   - For Python: Create `requirements.txt`
   - For Node.js: Create `package.json`
   - For Java: Create `pom.xml`

3. Add your source code following standard project structures

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create feature branches from `develop`
   - Implement your proof of concept
   - Ensure code follows language-specific conventions

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Add tests appropriate to your chosen stack
   - CI/CD will automatically run tests on push

3. **Code Quality**
   - Linting and formatting checks run automatically
   - Security scanning identifies vulnerabilities
   - Quality reports generated for each commit

## CI/CD Configuration

The repository includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/claude-code.yml`) that:

### Triggers
- Push to `main`, `master`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests targeting these branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Workflow Jobs

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Language detection
   - Dependency installation
   - Linting and formatting checks
   - Test execution
   - Security vulnerability scanning

2. **Documentation Generation**
   - Creates documentation stubs
   - Generates quality reports
   - Archives artifacts

### Quality Checks
- **Python**: flake8, black, mypy, pytest, safety
- **Node.js**: npm lint, npm test, npm audit
- **Java**: maven checkstyle, maven test

## Adding Your POC Code

To start your proof of concept:

1. **Python Project**:
   ```bash
   touch requirements.txt
   mkdir src tests
   # Add your Python code
   ```

2. **Node.js Project**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   mkdir src tests
   # Add your JavaScript code
   ```

3. **Java Project**:
   ```bash
   # Create Maven structure
   mkdir -p src/main/java src/test/java
   # Add pom.xml
   ```

## Security

- Automated security scanning on every commit
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- License compliance verification
